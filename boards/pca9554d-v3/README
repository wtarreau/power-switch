This is the 3rd version of the board using a PCA9554D (same pinout as
PCF8574D which should also work).

- open drain outputs using MOSFETs and 200 ohm resistors to protect
  against short-circuits

- GND placed left of output 0 instead of right of output 7

Board files were rendered at 60 microns per pixel (423.33 DPI) for laser
engraving or CNC etching but may also be printed for UV etching.
